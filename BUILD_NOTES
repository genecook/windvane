a64 simulator + simulation-trace GUI 'base code'.

Am slowly migrating the code base onto github. Bear with me.

The current build process is:

  # to compile the simulator:
  
  cd proto; make
  make

  # to compile the 'boot code' (assembly language snippets):
  
  cd boot_code; make

  # to build the simulator trace GUI:
  
  cd simtrace_viewer; make

  # to package up the GUI and 'install' same:
  
  make -f simtrace_viewer

To test:
  make test    # generates/checks a single test.

  bin/simtrace_viewer.sh   # invoke GUI in GUI src dir. use to load rndcode_test simulation trace.
